# SP22-ORIE-4999-Project
Updated as of May 2022

This project aims to automate the process of course selections for ORIE majors at Cornell University 
to ensure that students fulfill their graduation requirements.

## Description

According to resources listed in "Resources," the program takes in a student's list of courses
"CourseList1.csv" and prints to the "GraduationChecklist.csv" spreadsheet which fills in the
requirements the students satisfies and any unsatisfied courses will be left blank. The program
will then tell the student what requirement they are missing. A "Percentage to Graduate" feature
also shows the student what percentage of their requirements have been fulfilled.

## Resources
* Engineering Undergraduate Handbook (2021) contains all flowcharts and requirements
for each major and minor degree in the College of Engineering.
* ORIE Handbook (2021). We used this PDF as the source of possible ORIE electives that
a student can take to satisfy their Major Approved Electives requirements.
* Liberal Studies Requirements contains a guide for students entering in Fall 2020 and later
including the number of courses in each category of liberal studies that must be taken.
* Liberal Studies List of Courses contains a master list of all possible liberal studies
courses that one can take under tabs that represent the different categories. The "Other
Yes List" tab contains another list of approved liberal studies courses
